# CLI contract for humans, scripts and AI

Human-readable output is the default. Add `--json` to any finite command for one JSON object on stdout, on both success and failure. Normal JSON responses leave stderr empty; failure to write the response is reported on stderr. `daemon` is a long-running foreground text command; observe it with `status --json` from another process.

```sh
rydd capabilities --json
rydd status --json
rydd pause --json
rydd resume --json
rydd stop --json
rydd --data-dir /absolute/fixture/state status --json
```

Put global `--data-dir` before the command. `--json` can go before or after the command. Commands do not prompt. `capabilities --json` works without initialization and lists supported commands, effects, arguments, features and error codes. Unimplemented findings, duplicates and cleanup are explicitly false.

Every JSON response has `api_version: 1`, `ok` and `command`. Success fields depend on the command; status preserves its existing fields and adds `dispatch_budget`. Failures have `error.code` and a human-readable `error.message`. Match codes, not message text. Consumers must tolerate additional fields; incompatible contract changes require a new API version.

| Exit status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Operation failed (including unavailable worker, configuration/state errors) |
| 2 | Invalid arguments or unsupported output mode |

Control responses contain `acknowledged` and a worker snapshot. A stop acknowledgement means shutdown was requested; it does not guarantee process exit. Pause is durable and requests cancellation of the current cooperative batch; an active filesystem call can still be draining. Status reads saved inventory even without a worker. Paths may contain private information; treat reports as local data.

## Dispatch limits

`scan.max_scan_chunks_per_day` defaults to 288. The worker reserves each inventory chunk before starting it; reservations and the next permitted dispatch time survive restart. Cancellation or a crash does not refund a reservation. UTC midnight replenishes the count; moving the clock backwards does not refill it. The count uses a single database row. Existing configurations inherit the default.

Worker `wait_reason` reports `paused`, `running`, `idle`, `cadence`, `daily_chunk_limit`, `clock_rollback`, `wal_backpressure` or `stopping` where applicable. `dispatch_budget` is a separate saved-budget view, so its reason need not equal the worker's reason (for example, a paused worker can also have exhausted its daily quota). An empty budget reason means the budget currently permits dispatch; job retries may still delay work.

Above 32 MiB of WAL, a passive checkpoint gates new inventory chunks. If a reader pins pending pages, the worker defers scanning and retries after a minute while remaining controllable. A fully checkpointed but physically large WAL can be reused. This is backpressure, not a strict database-size cap; control/startup writes and the active chunk can still add data.

Batch reservations do not meter metadata calls, bytes or CPU. Fine-grained resource limits, battery/sleep integration and production resource measurements remain unfinished. Scanning remains experimental and opt-in on each worker start.

## Live scanner accounting

When experimental inventory is enabled, live worker snapshots include `inventory_metrics`. Human `status` prints the same counters. `capabilities --json` advertises `metadata_api_counters: true`; `metadata_rate_limit` remains false.

| Counter | Attempted scanner API calls |
| --- | --- |
| `stat_calls` | Stat, Fstat and Fstatat, including scope checks and revalidation |
| `directory_open_calls` | Open and Openat for directory descriptors |
| `directory_read_calls` | Readdirnames batches, including EOF reads |
| `filesystem_stat_calls` | Fstatfs filesystem checks |
| `mount_identity_calls` | Linux Statx mount-ID checks; zero on macOS |
| `path_resolution_calls` | EvalSymlinks calls for configured/protected paths |

Counters include startup validation, retries and failed attempts. They are fixed-size in-memory counters for one worker instance, reset on restart, and absent when no inventory scanner is running. Use the worker `instance` field when computing deltas. Each field is sampled independently; a live snapshot is not a transaction across all counters. Reading metrics does not acquire the scanner lock.

These count API attempts, not kernel syscalls or physical disk operations. In particular, EvalSymlinks can perform multiple internal metadata calls, and Readdirnames buffers directory reads. Descriptor closes, SQLite work and runtime activity are outside these counters. There is no per-path history, CPU/byte measurement or persisted metadata-consumption quota. Child-entry pacing is described below; the other API calls are not yet rate limited. Full metadata limiting must cover resolution internals and database work and preserve progress at low rates and short work deadlines.

## Child-entry pacing

The worker now uses `scan.metadata_per_second` (default 100) to space child-entry inspections. The first inspection can start immediately; subsequent starts are at least `1/rate` apart within the worker instance. Idle time does not accumulate burst credits. Failed child stat attempts also consume an inspection slot. This is an entry-inspection limit, not a limit on every metadata operation: directory traversal, mount checks, path resolution, directory-read buffering and SQLite work remain outside it. Capability discovery therefore reports `entry_rate_limit: true` and `metadata_rate_limit: false`.

`inventory_metrics` adds `entry_inspections`, `entry_rate_per_second`, `throttled` and `throttle_wait_ns`. Counts and completed wait durations reset per worker instance. The entry clock is also in memory; the separately persisted dispatch cadence and daily batch cap still apply across restarts. A continuously running worker does not perform a catch-up burst after sleep.

Throttle waits honor pause/stop cancellation. Each timed scan pass reserves half its remaining window for final path revalidation and returns a partial batch when it cannot afford another paced inspection. At most 128 unread names are retained in the single directory stream. Partial batches keep their enumeration generation and preserve pending names; a process restart or actual cancellation still restarts the directory safely with idempotent upserts. Empty partial batches are possible and still consume a dispatch reservation. A throttle yield does not mark a directory complete or record an error.

This prevents pacing alone from discarding every unfinished batch at low rates. It does not guarantee progress if kernel calls or path revalidation repeatedly exceed the work deadline, nor across continual cancellation/restarts. Resource and huge-directory acceptance gates remain open; use disposable fixtures while scanning is experimental.

## Future actions

Keep discovery, review and execution as explicit commands. Machine readability is not cleanup authorization: future actions must use exact plans, revalidation and explicit user approval or an already approved narrow policy. Destructive commands and idempotency keys will be designed when action execution is implemented.
